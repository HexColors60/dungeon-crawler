### This assignment does not fit all of the required specifications.
* Can specify number of monsters you want to generate with the --nummon flag.
* If you do not specify monsters with --nummon, between 10 and 20 monsters will
be generated.
* Monsters print in the dungeon with their respective hex representation based
on their type
* Monster types are generated, but traits of those types have not been defined.
* Movement has not been finished. I have created what I see as the functions
for intelligence and telepathic abilities, but I did not have time to create
erratic and tunneling abilities. I also did not have time to implement the
movement with the queue.
