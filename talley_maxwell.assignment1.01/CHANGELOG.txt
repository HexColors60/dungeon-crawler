CHANGELOG: DUNGEON GAME

**** BEGIN DUNGEON GENERATION (1.01)
  *** 01/20/17
    ** Set up structure of C file

  *** 01/22/17
    ** Begin creating rooms
      * Begin printing the dungeon to the terminal
      * Hardness now assigned to each array position
      * '.' assigned to rooms in the dungeon array
      * 0 assigned to rooms in the hardness array, 255 assigned to
      the outer edge to prevent anything from printing there

  *** 01/23/17
    ** Begin creating corridors
      * Created hardnessScan function that figures which direction is the most
      efficient to move in, considering direction and hardness of the rock

  *** 01/24/17
    ** Debugging corridor placement. Placement was way off from what it is
    supposed to be
    ** Added feature to print room number inside the room, for debugging purposes
    ** Gave up on doing complicated corridors because I didn't use structs, which
    I believe will be easier to use in the future.
    ** Began implementation of straight corridors
    ** Finished implementation of straight corridors
    ** Prevented printing of hashes on spaces with a hardness of 0
    ** Finished implementation of dungeon generation
