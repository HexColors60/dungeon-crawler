### This assignment fits the required specifications.
* PC randomly generates on the map if you don't include the --p flag
* Can specify PC location with `--p y x` flag, where x is
the col and y is the row you want to spawn in
* If pc is set on an unavailable location (dungeon boundary), it will be
randomly generated
* The pc can be set outside of a room or corridor. This is for testing
purposes
* Once the PC is set, the distance maps are generated using
an adapted version of the professor's dijkstra_corridor
function
* A second function was created to create the tunneling distance map because I
realized that in the tunneling map, you need to account for the hardness of the
rock. So I created a new function that is similar to the one for rooms, but
adds a "weight" into the calculation for dijkstra
* Once the distance map is generated, it is printed with the
`print_distance_map` function. This takes a `tunneling`
flag to determine which map to print
* Each distance map is printed below the actual map, starting
with the mapped rooms and then the entire dungeon
