### This assignment fits the required specifications.
* PC randomly generates on the map
* Can specify PC location with `--p x y` flag, where x is
the col and y is the row you want to spawn in
* Once the PC is set, the distance maps are generated using
an adapted version of the professor's dijkstra_corridor
function
    * This takes an int `tunneling` that determins whether
    to generate the distances for the entire map, or just
    the rooms and corridors.
* Once the distance map is generated, it is printed with the
`print_distance_map` function. This also takes a `tunneling`
flag.
* Each distance map is printed below the actual map, starting
with the mapped rooms and then the entire dungeon
