Assignment 1.07
    * This assignment meets all required guidelines
    * fileio.cpp is where all the new code is
    * Parses the file monster_desc.txt stored in getenv("HOME")/.rlg327
    * After parsing, prints out all parsed data (in same order that prof does
    in the assignment doc)
    * While parsing, stores the data in a vector called monst_desc that's
    stored in the dungeon class
        * Color is stored in a vector as an int (b/c the ncurses colors are enums)
        * Speed, hp, and damage are stored in arrays with 3 elements,
        accessed with enums base, dice, and sides
        * Abilities are stored in a vector as npc_characteristics_t -- adding onto
        the functionality the prof had in place beforehand
