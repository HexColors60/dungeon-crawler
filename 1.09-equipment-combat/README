* I wasn't able to finish the entire assignment. I got stuck on a bug
that ended up being extremely simple and it put me way behind.
* The PC picks up items as it walks over them
* The PC is able to equip items from the inventory
* You can view the inventory and the equipment that's being held
* You can delete an item from the game with the x key
* I wasn't able to get any of the combat completed

NOTE:
* When I was developing (on my Mac) I had no compile errors and no runtime
errors that I knew of. When I went to test my code on pyrite, I was suddenly
getting an error relating to 'non-static reference member can't use default
assignment operator.' At this point, it's extremely late (or early) and I'm
just going to turn it in. If you do happen to own a Mac and would be able to
run my code there, you'll have to uncomment the header file "endian.h" in
dungeon.h and comment out <endian.h>. Then it should run with all functionality
described above.
