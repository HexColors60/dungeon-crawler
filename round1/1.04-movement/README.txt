README 1.04

This program is supposed to place monsters in the dungeon and have them move according to their abilities.
As of this submission, the monsters go into the event queue successfully and can be removed. They are not being
removed at the correct time however and do not yet have abilities. All code additions have been added to rlg327.c.
