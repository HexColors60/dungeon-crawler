README - assignment 1.01

I began this project without using structs. I didn't even know they existed until
I had done most of the project. For that reason, I continued the project in the
way that I had started it and made corridors that were completely straight.

At the top of my main under my variable initializations, I begin by setting the
hardness of the rock. If the row or column is 0 or its max value, it was set to
255. Otherwise it is set to a value between 1 and 254.

ROOM GENERATION:
I initialize four variables (two for each x or y) to a
random number in their range. I then check if the variables added are less than
their max value. There is a function called roomCheck that checks to make sure
the generated room will be at least 1 space away from the nearest room. Otherwise
the room does not print. If room generation is successful, the center coordinates
are saved for corridor generation.

A range of 10 - 25 rooms is generated each time. The dungeon size ranges from
(7 x 5) to (15 x 10). No rooms print within the outside border of the map.

CORRIDOR GENERATION:
I have four variables here, two for each x or y (one for corridor start and one
for destination). Next I have a few conditions (the x and y conditions are the same).
Inside a while loop with the condition of current position not being equal to
destination, then if current > destination, the variable (x or y) is decreased,
otherwise it is increased.

Each of the rooms is connected to at least one corridor. No hashes are printed
inside the rooms. 

The last thing in my main method is printing, where I print the dungeon to
the terminal.
