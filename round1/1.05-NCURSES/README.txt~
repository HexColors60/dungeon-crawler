To get the character to move, I added all relevant ncurses functions to the
pc_next_pos function. It takes in a character from the user and checks if its a valid
character. If not, it asks for input again. The character can move using all
specified keys, plus wasd for simplicity. Relevant code relating to going up and
down stairs is also included in this function.

To get the staircases to print in the dungeon, I added two new enums called
ter_floor_stair_up and ter_floor_stair_down. I also created a new function called
create_stairs. A room has a 1 in 5 chance of containing a staircase and a 50% chance
of it either being up or down. Each staircase is placed in or near the middle of the room
for simplicity. Render dungeon was altered to use ncurses prints (mvaddch) instead
of putchars. The characters '>' and '<' were added here.

The 80x24 window does not work perfectly yet. There is still a bug on the far left side.
I have not added the look mode yet either. I was going to perfect the window before
I created that mode because they would work almost identical.
