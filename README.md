# CS327
## Advanced Programming in C

In this class, you create a roguelike game, similar to command line games like NetHack. 

0-abelian-sandpile is the only program that is separate.

**To run the Abelian Sandpile program**
1. Pull the repo
1. Navigate to 0-abelian-sandpile
1. Type `make` on the command line
1. Run the compiled binary with `./sandpile`

Each assignment beginning with a 1 is the roguelike game. Every assignment adds further functionality to the gameplay.

### 1.01-dungeon-generation
Generates an empty, fully connected dungeon. Each space in the dungeon has an assigned hardness for future use.

### 1.02-dungeon-save-load
Adds the ability to save and load to a folder in the home directory. This will allow for the continuation of gameplay in the future.

**To run a particular assignment:**
1. Pull the repo
1. Navigate to the assignment that you want to run
1. Type `make` on the command line
1. Run the compiled binary with `./dungeon`
