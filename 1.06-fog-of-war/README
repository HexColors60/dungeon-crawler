Assignment 1.05
* This assignment meets all the required specifications.
* The functionality of each of the required keys is as specified
in the assignment doc.
* I believe this is normal behavior (was reading about it online)
but there is a delay in the escape key -- it takes 1000 ms to
register that it was pressed.
* While in the dungeon view, it displays MOVE at the top of the screen
* While in the monster list mode, it displays VIEW_MONSTERS and how many
monsters are in the map.
* For ease of debugging and code-correctness checking, the list of
monsters is indexed at the right of the type and position relative 
to pc
