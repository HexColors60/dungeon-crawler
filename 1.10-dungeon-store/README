1.10 -- Dungeon Store
* For this assignment, I created a dungeon store
* The store is rendered with + signs
* If one of the store room dimensions is smaller than 3 units,
no objects will spawn in the room.
* When the PC is in the store, as you walk over items it will display how
much gold you have, how much the item costs, and the name of it.
* Price is loosely based on the average damage of an item -- higher damage
items are more expensive.
* Every item in the dungeon has a price, and if there is an open space in the
item area of the store, you can drop the item there to sell it and receive the
amount of gold that it's worth.

* When I run this on my Mac, everything works fine. When I run it on pyrite, I
get a floating point exception. This is because the size of the object descriptions
vector in object.cpp:gen_objects() is 0. I get this for the unaltered 1.09 solution
as well, so I believe it's just an issue with the object_desc.txt file. I
wanted to make note of it here however, just in case.
