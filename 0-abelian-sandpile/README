README

This project contains all necessary functionality. Grains are dropped
in the center of the map, then radiate out in the cardinal directions
when they become unstable. fillMapWithCommandLineValues (line 40) handles command
line arguments passed. dropSand (line 53) drops sand in the center. handlePiles
(line 58) is what handles the toppling of piles. checkUnstable (line 80) checks
whether a simulation turn is ready to be ended or not.
