#Conway's Game of Life

#This program emulates Conway's Game of Life. We were told that the game should be around
#100 lines of code. Mine very obviously is not. I tried to approach it creatively at first,
#but ran out of time near the end. So that's why there are more than 100 lines.

#You can find my "count" function starting on line 74. This function counts up all
#the surrounding cells in its 3x3 neighborhood, not including itself. It puts the
#count within the global "counter" function.

#You can fund my "rules" function on line 252. This function takes the count of
#each space from the "counter" array and applies the rules to them.
